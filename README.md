# periodo
*Period + toDo*

A simple todo management application, with a time allocation.

## Motivation
I need it, so I started designing idea.
And I thought "wow maybe I can make this into web application stuff",
then I decided to make it as web application. (Wow such logical)

## How this works
This project is under developing now, so this doesn't work now.
There is no website to public this yet.

If you want to see how the developing going, or you are interested to
contribute to this project (omg really), clone me, and run this:

```
yarn dev
```

And periodo (which is under developing) runs at http://localhost:8080.
Webpack is nice.
